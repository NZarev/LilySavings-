1. Declare Variables and Initialize Scanner
  Start by initializing a Scanner to take input.
  Declare variables:
    age: an integer to store Lily's current age.
    washingMachinePrice: a double to store the price of the washing machine.
    toyPrice: an integer to store the price of a toy.
    totalMoney: a double to accumulate the total money Lily saves.
    moneyFromToys: a double to store the money accumulated from receiving toys on her odd-numbered birthdays.
2. Read Input Values
  Read the input values for:
    age
    washingMachinePrice
    toyPrice
3. Calculate Money Accumulated Over the Years
  Loop through each year from 1 to age:
    For even-numbered birthdays (Lily receives money from her family):
      Calculate the amount of money Lily receives for her birthday, increasing by 10 units each even year.
      Subtract 1 from this amount to account for her brother taking $1 on each even birthday.
      Add the remaining money from the birthday to totalMoney.
For odd-numbered birthdays (Lily receives toys):
Add the value of one toy to moneyFromToys.
